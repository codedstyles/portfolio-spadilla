                    <h4 class="subtitles">Overview</h4>


                    These days we are connected more than ever and with statistics like stated by Ian Blair co-founder of BuildFire:
                    <ul>
                        <li>82% of Internet users in the United States have used a mobile device to shop online</li>
                        <li>35% of US consumers use only their mobile device to buy online</li>
                        <li>In 2017, the US had $156 billion in mobile commerce sales</li>
                        <li>By 2021, experts estimate that US mobile commerce sales will eclipse $420 billion</li>
                        <li>Conversion rates from mobile apps are three times higher than mobile sites</li>
                        <li>Mobile shoppers spend twice as much money as other customers</li>
                        <li>42% of smartphone users plan to do more shopping from their mobile devices in the coming year</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Taking advantage of this ample data, the startup Sello was created, designing an app where people can be buyers and sellers to a social market place from all over the United States.</p>

                    <p>Sello was in the concept validation phase when the pandemic started to go global, so work ramped up to meet new deadlines and be ready with phase 1 (phase after vaildation) much sooner than planned as we saw a much higher need for our product.</p>

                    Sello’s differentiator:
                    <ul>
                        <li>The main focus of the app is to make buying and selling a fun, easy and interactive experience.</li>
                        <li>As a seller, you have your own online store, with full-service support, integration and analytics.</li>
                        <li>As a buyer, you have access to a diversity of online stores all in one place.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4 class="subtitles">Discovery Session</h4>
                    This development stage was to learn:
                    <ul>
                        <li>About the company - gathered information about the company's history, key milestones and so on, their corporate values, often written into mission or vision statements.</li>
                        <li>The industry - researched the industry's history, size, products, geographic scope (including both manufacturing centers and consumer centers), trends and growth patterns that have existed within the industry as well as factors that influence it.</li>
                        <li>The company's Business Model - what makes users go back to the app, how can the user get value from our solution, also developed to create value for stakeholders.</li>
                        <li>Short and long-term goals - along with a long-term goal we need to have many short-term goals to stay on track and accountable for every one of our decisions.</li>
                        <li>Competition Audit - helped develop new marketing strategies and aided us in discovering valuable ways to position our product.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4 class="subtitles">Explore Solutions</h4>
                    <p>To develop the winning concept, I used an iterative process, gathering information from the Discovery phase to be able to define the problem, generate ideas and inspiration, to then go back and forth between a creative and analytical exploration and finish, by organizing and refining these first ideas into a concept that can be fully developed, using the fundamentals of design in a way that communicates clearly our demarked concept.</p>

                    <!--FIRST SKETCHES
                    <a href="https://placeholder.com"><img src="https://via.placeholder.com/600x500"></a>-->

                    <p>A User story was created to define the following:</p>

                    <ol>
                        <li>Frame the problem</li>
                        <li>Understand the product’s users</li>
                        <li>Map user activities</li>
                        <li>Map user stories under activities</li>
                        <li>Flow and prioritize</li>
                        <li>Identify gaps, dependencies, technical requirements, and alternatives</li>
                    </ol>

                    <strong>As a</strong> buyer
                    <p><strong>I want</strong> to be able to purchase a product from 2 blocks away to the other side of the US.
                        <br><strong>So that</strong> I can have access to a wide selection of products and prices
                        <br><strong>Given</strong> I am registered and logged in to the app
                        <br><strong>When</strong> I favorite a product, interact with a buyer or want to make a purchase
                        <br><strong>Then</strong> I can start my purchase journey and be fully engaged with the app
                        <br><strong>Models</strong> Wireframes, prototypes, screen mock ups
                    </p>

                    <strong>As a</strong> seller
                    <p><strong>I want</strong> to be able to sell to buyers that are located 2 blocks away or in any other state.
                        <br><strong>So that</strong> I can have a wide variety of customers
                        <br><strong>Given</strong> I am registered and logged in to the app
                        <br><strong>When</strong> I add a product I am selling, I can start interacting with possbile buyers.
                        <br><strong>Then</strong> I can start selling and be fully engaged with the app
                    </p>

                    <h4 class="subtitles">Design</h4>
                    <p>The style guide was the first step to what will eventually grow into a Design System, which will be evolving constantly with the product, the tools and the new technologies. The design presents a simple but playful scheme, with the use of a colorful and lively color palette, a modern sans-serif typeface and legible design elements.</p>

                    Color palette
                    <ul>
                        <li>Dominant color: Turquoise. This is a color that recharges the mind during times of mental stress and tiredness, along with alleviating feelings of loneliness. Engaging with this color, gives you a feeling of instant calmness. It is a great color to have around you, as it helps with clear thinking and decision-making.</li>
                        <li>Secondary colors: shades of grey and white to bring a nice contrast with the dominant color.</li>
                    </ul>

                    Typface
                    <ul>
                        <li>FF Din typeface has a strong, modern and solid feel.</li>
                        <li>Font Styles light, light italic, regular, medium, bold.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto img-spacing" src="img/portfolio/ecommerce-design.png" alt="">

                    <h4 class="subtitles">User Testing</h4>
                    <p>With over 1.5 million apps in the App Store, there’s enough competition to know that the “build it and they will come” philosophy won’t be enough to make our apps successful.</p>

                    <p>One of the best ways to make an app stand out from the competition and be a user's favorite, is through app user testing. App user testing is a process that evaluates the usability, functionality, user experience, and design of an app by testing it with real people.</p>

                    <p>App user testing is an important part of app development, so it cannot be minimized or not implemented, being that the main goal of user testing is to find out if the app can be easily and intuitively used for its intended purposes.</p>

                    <p>With the above in mind, early beta testing clued us into issues that could have been troublesome in later stages. So testing revealed the strong and weak points of the app, giving us the answers we were looking for and by learning where and what needed improvement, we were able to come out with the best version of the app.</p>

                    <p>Lab Testing - we started with a small sample of users that resembled our ideal set of users and while having a large batch of testers is always a plus, we learned plenty from this number of testing participants, as they provided an abundance of insights into where our app needed improvement. From what we learned from our first testers, we equally received great feedback from the next testing group we gathered. Allowing us to continuously improve with each test group and easily detect if similar issues kept appearing.</p>
                    <p>Usability Hub - this free tool allowed us to test and evaluate our various designs, navigation and screen flows by submitting designs to the larger user testing community.</p>
                    The tests performed on Usability Hub:
                    <ul class="bottom-link-space">
                        <li>Question Test: we collected user feedback from questions asked to real individuals.</li>
                        <li>Navflow: allowed us to see how effectively users navigated the app.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <!--
<h4 class="subtitles">Results &amp; Implementation</h4>
In this first phase of implementation we were able to acquire 100 customers in the first 6 months of launching, by making the following our priorities:
<ul class="bottom-link-space">
    <li>Being empathetic to our users and by seeing it from their perspective (being in their shoes), at the end of the day, we were able to make sound decisions.</li>
    <li>Understand how people interacted with our app and this way boost engagement.</li>
    <li>Learn the needs, pain points and our user's differentiators, to able to provide a solution that benefited them.</li>
</ul>
