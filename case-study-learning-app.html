                    <p class="par-style">Client: Learning app | Category: UI/UX Design</p>

                    <h4 class="subtitles">Overview</h4>
                    <p>The pandemic has changed the way schools and universities teach, how companies work and now all have been forced to go remote. This has also created a boom in the online learning enviroment, although even before the pandemic, markets had forecasted the online education market to $350 Billion by 2025, so the numbers might be updated after analyzing the growth impacts of COVID-19 on the online learning market.</p> 

                    <p>Digital Factory was in the concept validation phase when the pandemic started to go global, so work ramped up to meet new deadlines and be ready with phase 1 (after vaildation) much sooner than planned as we saw a much higher need for our product.</p>

                    Digital Factory’s differentiator:
                    <ul>
                        <li>The main focus of the app is to make learning an entertaining experience.</li>
                        <li>The subjects taught in each course are for the most in-demand jobs of the future.</li>
                        <li>The teachers are industry experts with many accolades.</li>
                        <li>Each course is structured in a way that engages the 7 types of learners.</li>
                        <li>After the pandemic, this learning app can be used any time and on-the-go.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4 class="subtitles">Discovery Session</h4>
                    This development stage was to learn:
                    <ul>
                        <li>About the company - gatthered information about the company's history, key milestones and so on, their corporate values, often written into mission or vision statements.</li>
                        <li>The industry - researched the industry's history, size, products, geographic scope (including both manufacturing centers and consumer centers), trends and growth patterns that have existed within the industry as well as factors that influence it.</li>
                        <li>The company's Business Model - what makes users go back to the app, how can the user get value from our solution, also developed to create value for stakeholders.</li>
                        <li>Short and long-term goals - along with a long-term goal we need to have many short-term goals to stay on track and accountable for every one of our decisions.</li>
                        <li>Competition Audit - helped develop new marketing strategies and aided us in discovering valuable ways to position our product.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4 class="subtitles">Explore Solutions</h4>
                    <p>To develop the winning concept, I used an iterative process, gathering information from the Discovery phase to be able to define the problem, generate ideas and inspiration, to then go back and forth between a creative and analytical exploration and finish, by organizing and refining these first ideas into a concept that can be fully developed, using the fundamentals of design in a way that communicates clearly our demarked concept.</p>

                    <p>A User story was created to define the following:</p>

                    <ol>
                        <li>Frame the problem</li>
                        <li>Understand the product’s users</li>
                        <li>Map user activities</li>
                        <li>Map user stories under activities</li>
                        <li>Flow and prioritize</li>
                        <li>Identify gaps, dependencies, technical requirements, and alternatives</li>
                    </ol>

                    <h4 class="subtitles">Design</h4>
                    <p>The style guide was the first step to what will eventually grow into a Design System, which will be evolving constantly with the product, the tools and the new technologies. The design presents a simple but playful scheme, with the use of a colorful and lively color palette, a modern sans-serif typeface and legible design elements.</p>

                    Color palette
                    <ul>
                        <li>Dominant color: red. This color was chosen, because it is a stimulating color to our senses, making us more sensitive to our environments. Red also stimulates the adrenal gland, making us more prone to take action and bringing us more energy.</li>
                        <li>Secondary colors: shades of grey and white to bring a nice contrast with the dominant color.</li>
                    </ul>

                    Typface
                    <ul>
                        <li>FF Din typeface has a strong, modern and solid feel.</li>
                        <li>Font Styles light, light italic, regular, medium, bold.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto img-spacing" src="img/portfolio/DF-design1.png" alt="">
                    <img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto img-spacing" src="img/portfolio/DF-design2.png" alt="">

                    <h4 class="subtitles">User Testing</h4>
                    <p>With over 1.5 million apps in the App Store, there’s enough competition to know that the “build it and they will come” philosophy won’t be enough to make our apps successful.</p>

                    <p>One of the best ways to make an app stand out from the competition and be a user's favorite, is through app user testing. App user testing is a process that evaluates the usability, functionality, user experience, and design of an app by testing it with real people.</p>

                    <p>App user testing is an important part of app development, so it cannot be minimized or not implemented, being that the main goal of user testing is to find out if the app can be easily and intuitively used for its intended purposes.</p>

                    <p>With the above in mind, early beta testing clued us into issues that could have been troublesome in later stages. So testing revealed the strong and weak points of the app, giving us the answers we were looking for and by learning where and what needed improvement, we were able to come out with the best version of the app.</p>

                    <p>Lab Testing - we started with a small sample of users that resembled our ideal set of users and while having a large batch of testers is always a plus, we learned plenty from this number of testing participants, as they provided an abundance of insights into where our app needed improvement. From what we learned from our first testers, we equally received great feedback from the next testing group we gathered. Allowing us to continuously improve with each test group and easily detect if similar issues kept appearing.</p>
                    <p>Usability Hub - this free tool allowed us to test and evaluate our various designs, navigation and screen flows by submitting designs to the larger user testing community.</p>
                    The tests performed on Usability Hub:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Question Test: we collected user feedback from questions asked to real individuals.</li>
                        <li>Navflow: allowed us to see how effectively users navigated the app.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4 class="subtitles">Results &amp; Implementation</h4>
                    In this first phase of implementation we were able to acquire 100 customers in the first 6 months of launching, by making the following our priorities:
                    <ul class="bottom-link-space">
                        <li>Being empathetic to our users and by seeing it from their perspective (being in their shoes), at the end of the day, we were able to make sound decisions.</li>
                        <li>Understand how people interacted with our app and this way boost engagement.</li>
                        <li>Learn the needs, pain points and our user's differentiators, to able to provide a solution that benefited them.</li>
                    </ul>
